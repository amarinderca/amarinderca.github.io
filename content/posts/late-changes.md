### changes:

* Changes to my main build. Sold the 2060KO GPU, 2x sticks of RAM, 24" MSI 1080p 144hz curved Monitor and EVGA GQ 650 Watt PSU.
* Upgraded to 27" LG 27GL83A-B 1440p 144hz monitor, Corsair RM850x PSU, EVGA XC3 3070 GPU.
* New GPU did +130/+1400 vcore/vram OC. Changed 3900x manual OC to PBO level 3 OC.
